The customer churn dataset is a collection of customer data that focuses on predicting customer churn, which refers to the tendency of customers to stop using a company's products or services. The dataset contains various features that describe each customer, such as their credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card status, active membership, estimated salary, and churn status. The churn status indicates whether a customer has churned or not. The dataset is used to analyze and understand factors that contribute to customer churn and to build predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. The goal is to develop strategies and interventions to reduce churn and improve customer retention

## Collection process

Collection process is not known , but it seems it is been generated by bank and given as part of this analyis , this is taken from broader bank data set. colection period is also not known.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Data had no missing record as such,
- To make it suitable for the all 3 models,string for Country and Sex need to be converted to numeric, created dummies for country and sex,
- country_num=pd.get_dummies(X["Country"],drop_first=True) and similarly created dummies for sex Sex_num=pd.get_dummies(X['sex'],drop_first=True).
- As the values of Balance and est Salary was in large range so scalling done for overall data set using standard scaler  -scaled_value = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaled_value.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaled_value.transform(X_test)
 
## Uses
Data set was created for churn analysis so should be used for this purpose only.
is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups- Not as such 


## Distribution

Data fairly was normal distribution for almost all fields.
- Its open data source as mentioned in Kaggle.

## Maintenance
