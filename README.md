# Models to analyse customer churn at a bank . Created 3 ML Models and comparison done and recommended better model.  .


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
Customer Chrun is a major challenge for almost every industry. Specially for Banks this has a negative impact as bank's customer are generally long term and it take time to build that relation ship .  Analysis of customer churn  and reducing it by adopting different strategies is one of top priority for the banks.  To Anlayze customer churn at bank have build 3 models 1. Based on Logistic regression 2. based on Neural Network 3. Based on Decision Tree.

## DATA
Data used is from Kaggle ,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhuviranga/customer-churn-data. data has 10000 record , its an open data source .this data has features like credit score, balance , country , estimated salary , vintage of customer , credit card relatioship  and outcome customer churned or not.

## MODEL 
A summary of the model youâ€™re using and why you chose it. 

i created 3 models to do comparision and recommending a final model , these 3 models are based on 1. Logisitic regression 2 Neural Network based on Tensorflow with different batch size epoch varying from 10 to 50 3. DecisionTreeClassifier with different max depth.  Both Neural Network and high depth DT performed almost same but Tree depth with 5 may be overfitting scenario so recommended  neural network with bbatch size 10 epoch 50.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION

For Neural network Hyperparameter tuned were 1. Number of hidden layers, started with 11-8-4-1 ( 1 input layer , 2 hidden layers and 1 output) but setted with 1 input-1 hidden-and 1 output.   2. Number of nodes in each layer started with 11-6-4-1 but turn out to be 11-8-1 perfomed better 3. Epoch and Batch Size , epoch tuned from 10 to 50 and bbatch size tuned from 20 to 10.

## RESULTS
A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model 
Model 1 which is based on Logistic regression scored- Score of logistic regression is 80.66%
Model 2 - Neural Network based model with different epoch ,batch size , different hidden layer and nodes scored between 83-86%
Model 3 - Decision Tree based model with different depth of default to 2 to 5 scored between 81-85.5%,  bigger depth like 5 may lead to overfitting so recommended Model2.
